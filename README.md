This project is a first-person shooter prototype.
The project is a console program and has been created to practice C#, specifically OOP, reading from a text file, repetition of data types, and so on.
The game includes a skill.cfg file, which contains the characteristics of weapons, enemies, and supplies.
This prototype can be used as an example for writing video games using other programming languages.
